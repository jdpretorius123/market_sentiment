"""Fetches and uploads news sentiment data into R2.

The Alpha Vantage API is used to collect historical news sentiment data for 10 tech
tickers of my choice. Four tickers are for mega-cap companies, three
are for medium-cap companies, and three are for small-cap companies.

NewsAPI is used to collect recent publications (articles, periodicals, etc.)
associated with those companies.

Together, this data enables longitudinal sentiment and trend analysis for these
companies, as well hopefully help explain trends in their stock price.

This script initiates the acquisition of data from Alpha Vantage and NewsAPI for each
selected tech ticker through their respective APIs. The details from each transaction
are used to create a monthly batch ID and metadata. Batch IDs, metadata, and
usable/unusable API transaction data are uploaded into R2. Successful API transactions,
their information and usable data, are captured by the FetchResult dataclass;
unsuccessful transactions by the FetchFailure dataclass.
